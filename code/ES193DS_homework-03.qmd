### Problem 1. Multiple linear regression: model selection and construction (52 points)

Use the information from the `homework-starter-doc.qmd` to do this problem.

#### a. Make a table *or* list of all the models from class and the last one you constructed on your own. Write a caption for your table. (8 points)

**Caption:** table captions typically go above the table. Number the table and provide a title. Describe what is in the table (columns and rows).

**Table:** In your table, each row should be a model with the model number (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the predictors for each model.

```{r}
# comparing models
modelsummary::modelsummary( # this function takes a list of models
  list( 
    "null" = model0, # "model name" = model object
    "model 1" = model1,
    "model 2" = model2,
    "model 3" = model3,
    "model 4" = model4
  )
) 

```

```{r}
# making a matrix called 'all_models'
all_models <- tribble(
  # specify column titles
  ~model, ~intercept, ~sla, ~well_watered, ~Encelia_californica, ~Eschscholzia_californica, ~Grindelia_camporum, ~Nasella_pulchra, ~Penstemon_centranthifolius, ~Salvia_leucophylla, ~AIC, ~deltaAIC,
  # specify row names and values
  "null", 0.279, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, -75.2,81.22,
  "model 1", 0.080, 0, 0.122, 0.238, 0.234, 0.330, 0.241, 0.061, 0.117, -157.5, 2.44,
  "model 2", 0.047, 0.001, 0.090, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, -96.4, 60.37,
  "model 3", -0.033	, 0.001, NA, 0.115, 0.222, 0.226, 0.168, -0.006, 0.139, -127.1, 32.12,
  "model 4", 0.055, NA, 0.0117, 0.218, 0.232, 0.313, 0.229, 0.050, 0.120, -159.2, 0
)

# display matrix  
all_models
```

```{r}
# turning everything into a flextable
  flextable(all_models) %>% 
  # changing the column names to look nicer
  set_header_labels(well_watered = "Well watered",
                    Encelia_californica = " Encelia californica",
                    Eschscholzia_californica = "Eschscholzia californica",
                    Grindelia_camporum = "Grindelia camporum,",
                    Nasella_pulchra = "Nasella pulchra",
                    Penstemon_centranthifolius = "Penstemon centranthifolius",
                    Salvia_leucophylla = "Salvia leucophylla",
                    deltaAIC = "delta AIC") %>% 
  # adding headers
  add_header_row(colwidths = c(2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2),
                 values = c("", "", "Water treatment","Species", "", "")) %>%
  # adding caption
  set_caption(caption = as_paragraph(colorize("Table 1. Rows are models and columns show the intercept, predictors (sla, water treatment, and species), AIC, and ∆AIC. Cells for each predictor contain model estimate values.", color = "black"))) %>% 
  # changing theme and width of table
  theme_vanilla() %>% 
  width(width = 10)
 
```

#### b. Write a 5-6 sentence "statistical methods" section. (8 points)

Your answer should be in paragraph form and include:

-   how you addressed the central question(s) (i.e. to examine the influence of \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_ on \_\_\_\_\_, I...)\
-   how you chose the final model (i.e. to determine the model that best described \_\_\_\_, I...)\
-   how you visually determined that your final model conformed to the assumptions of a linear model (i.e. to evaluate linear model assumptions, I...)

**To examine the influence of specific leaf area, water treatment, and species on total biomass, I used a linear model to test my null hypothesis, which was that these variables do not predict total biomass, and my saturated model, which was that all three variables predict total biomass. To determine the model that best described total biomass, I used the Multi-Model Inference (MuMIn) package and looked at which model contained the lowest AIC, which was model 4. To evaluate linear model assumptions, I looked at the diagnostic plots to visually assess for normality and homoscedasticity and used Cook's distance to determine that no outliers were influencing my model predictions.**

#### c. Make a visualization of the model predictions with underlying data for your "best" model. (20 points)

Show and annotate all your code. For full credit:

-   make the underlying data more transparent than the model predictions\
-   display species names in full (not as species codes like ENCCAL or ESCCAL)\
-   display water treatment types in full (not as WW or DS)\
-   represent well-watered and drought stressed treatments with different colors\
-   use colors that are *not* the default `ggplot()` colors\
-   facet your plot by species\
-   remove the legend\
-   finalize the plot

```{r}
# model predictions for model 4
model_preds <- ggpredict(model4, 
                         terms = c("water_treatment", 
                                   "species_name"))
```

```{r}
# creating new data frame of model predictions for plotting
model_preds_for_plotting <- model_preds %>% 
  # renaming columns to make this easier to use
  rename(water_treatment = x,
         species_name = group)
```

```{r}
# visualization of the model predictions with underlying data for model 4
ggplot() +
  # underlying data
  geom_jitter(data = drought_exp_clean,
              # x-axis
             aes(x = water_treatment,
                 #y-axis
                 y = total_g,
                 # color by water_treatment
                 color = water_treatment),
             # make points more transparent
             alpha = 0.2,
             # make jittered points narrower
             width = 0.2) +
  # model predictions with 95% CI 
  geom_pointrange(data = model_preds_for_plotting,
              aes(x = water_treatment, 
                  y = predicted,
                  ymin = conf.low,
                  ymax = conf.high,
                  color = water_treatment),
              alpha = 0.9,
              size = 0.3) +
  # change color of model predictions with 95% CI and underlying data
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Well watered" = "orchid", "Drought stressed" = "darkgreen")) +
  # cleaner theme
  theme_classic() +
  # creating different panels for species
  facet_wrap(~species_name) +
  # rename x and y axes
  labs(x = "Water treatment",
       y = "Total biomass (g)") +
  # remove legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
```

#### d. Write a caption for your visualization. (6 points)

**Figure 1. Predicted values of total biomass as a function of water treatment and species**\
**Data from 'Dryad' package (Valliere J, Zhang J, Sharifi M., Rundel P, 2019). Jittered points represent observations of the total biomass (g) of species in well watered and drought stressed water treatments, (total n = 70). The center dot represents the model prediction of total biomass of species for each water treatment, and the whiskers represent 95% CI. Colors represent water treatment type (pink = well watered, green = drought stressed).**

#### e. Write a 3-4 sentence results section. (10 points)

Your answer should be in paragraph form and address the following points:

-   what predictors "best" described total mass (include model statistics here)?\
-   on average, what differences did you find between water treatments?\
-   on average, what differences did you find between species?

**Results:**\
**We found that water treatments and species significantly predicted total biomass, but not SLA (Table 1). Across species on average, plants in well watered treatment are 0.12 ± 0.017 g greater than plants in drought stressed treatment. Across water treatments on average, Eschscholzia californica plants are 0.23 ± 0.032 g more than Acmispon glaber (F(7, 62) = 27.08, p \< 0.001, ⍺ = 0.05, adjusted R2 = 0.73).**

### Problem 2. Affective visualization (24 points)

In this problem, you will create an **affective visualization** using your personal data in preparation for workshop during week 10.

In lecture, we talked about the three vertices of data visualization: 1) exploratory, 2) affective, and 3) communicative. We've done a lot of exploratory and communicative visualization, but have yet to think about affective visualization.

When thinking of affective visualization, you can expand your ideas of what data visualization *could* be. Some examples of affective visualizations include:

-   [Jill Pelto's paintings](https://www.jillpelto.com/gallery-1)\
-   [Lorraine Woodruff-Long's warming strips quilt](https://www.instagram.com/p/C689Kybxget/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)\
-   [Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi's Dear Data project](https://www.dear-data.com/all)

**Before starting, update your spreadsheet of observations.**

#### a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data (3-5 sentences). (2 points)

**For my personal data, I could crochet a square, with each stitch representing how much I spend for each meal, and use different colors to represent the meal type. I could also have each row represent each week, and use white yarn to fill in the remaining stitches and separate each purchase (each row will have 50 stitches). This will allow me to see which meals I tend to spend the most money on and see which weeks I spent the most and least amount of money. I could also separate each month by using a contrasting yarn color.**

#### b. Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea. (2 points)

![](images/IMG_2013.jpeg){width="428"}

#### c. Make a draft of your visualization. (12 points)

Feel free to be creative with this! *You do not have to do this in R.* You could create a sculpture, painting, textile object, etc.

If you are making your visualization in R, show the annotated code and the output.

If you are making your visualization outside of R, include a photo of your visualization in your submission.

![](images/IMG_2012.jpeg)

#### d. Write an artist statement. (8 points)

An artist statement gives the audience context to understand your work. Write 4-5 sentences to address:

-   the content of your piece (what are you showing?)\
-   the influences (what did techniques/artists/etc. did you find influential in creating your work?)\
-   the form of your work (written code, watercolor, oil painting, etc.)\
-   your process (how did you create your work?)

**This crochet piece represents my weekly and monthly spending habits on food, with each stitch representing the cost of a meal (USD, rounded up to the nearest whole number) and each row representing each week, with a series of 5 black stitches to represent the start of a new month. The colors represent the type of meal (blue = lunch, light brown = snack, dark brown = dinner), and the white yarn is used to fill the remaining space in each row (rows contain 50 stitches each) and separate each purchase. This piece is influenced by Lorraine Woodruff-Long's warming strips quilt representing global temperature change, which inspired me to show how my spending habits on food changed over time. I created this piece by first calculating what my max cost of food was each week to determine how many stitches to include in each row. I then started crocheting, adding in each color, filler, and divider until I reached the end of my observations.**

### Problem 3. Statistical critique (36 points)

At this point, you have seen and created a lot of figures for this class. Revisit the paper you chose for your critique and your homework 2, where you described figures or tables in the text. Address the following in full sentences (3-4 sentences each).

**For this section of your homework, you will be evaluated on the logic, conciseness, and nuance of your critique.**

#### a. Revisit and summarize (6 points)

What are the statistical tests the authors are using to address their main research question?

**The authors used Mann–Whitney Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests to address their main research question: "How well stakeholders are included in and protected from groundwater depletion in Sustainability Plans under California's Sustainable Groundwater Management?"** ![](images/Mann–Whitney_Wilcoxon_Rank-Sum_tests.png){width="406"}

#### b. Visual clarity (10 points)

How clearly did the authors *visually* represent their statistics in figures? For example, are the x- and y-axes in a logical position? Do they show summary statistics (means and SE, for example) and/or model predictions, and if so, do they show the underlying data?

**The authors clearly labeled their x- and y-axes and labeled each subplot in a larger font to distinguish that the plots show different integration components. They also use contrasting colors to represent each integration score that also follows a blue theme, making the statistics visually pleasing and easy to read. They also provide a legend that shows readers what each color represents and what color/score is associated with being high, moderate, and low.**

#### c. Aesthetic clarity (10 points)

How well did the authors handle "visual clutter"? How would you describe the the data:ink ratio?

**There is minimal "visual clutter" in this figure as there are no grid lines or redundant information that make the plot difficult to read. The bars also clearly represent each score using colors that are easy to distinguish between. However, the title of the subplots seems out of place, being next to the y-axis title. The legend is also clearly labeled and in a logical location that doesn't interfere with the data in the plots. I would describe the data:ink ratio as fairly high because the labels are informative, the percentages are lightened while the titles are in bold, which creates a contrast that helps reduce clutter, there's no clutter in the background, and the bars are clearly separated.**

#### d. Recommendations (can be longer than 4 sentences, 10 points)

What recommendations would you make to make the figure better? What would you take out, add, or change? Provide explanations/justifications for each of your recommendations.

**Alternatively**, if they did not represent their statistics in a figure, what kind of figure would you recommend to them? Describe the x- and y-axes, with any geometries and aesthetics (colors, etc.). Provide enough explanation such that someone would be able to create the figure you describe in code. Provide explanations/justifications for the figure you would recommend.

**To make the figure better, I would label each subdivision of the bars with the percentage it represents. It can be misleading to look at the top of each subdivision to determine the percentage because they don't all start at 0%. So, labeling each subdivision allows people to look at the data without having to do calculations to determine the percentage. I would also put the title of the subplots on top of each subplot so people don't confuse the title with the y-axis title or get confused about which title represents the y-axis. I would also organize the plots in a 2x2 format rather than a 1x4 format so that you can easily compare the plots without having to scroll down to look at all the plots together.**
